My app uses https://www.googleapis.com/auth/carddav and https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar to allow Thunderbird users to access and manage their google contacts and calendars within the Thunderbird addressbook and the Thunderbird calendar.

My app also allows to modify, add and delete contacts and events, I therefore need full write access.



I have created a video, that shows my app in action and also shows some details of the network traffic generated by my app, where the client id and scopes transmitted to teh google server can be seen:

This is an updated verification request, as I did not include my scopes in the first request. I also changed the app icon to match the icon of the app as shown in Thunderbird:
